**VMware Cloud on AWS:**
(VMC on AWS) is a managed cloud offering that provides dedicated VMware vSphere-based Software Defined Data Centers (SDDC) that are hosted within AWS facilities.

Key Points before start VMS on AWS: 
1. The service utilizes facilities and hardware that are owned and managed by AWS
2. The service provides dedicated, private cloud environments in the form of an SDDC.
3. Hosts of an SDDC are dedicated to that SDDC
4. SDDCs are deployed within a *VMware-owned AWS account*, not a *customer-owned AWS account*.
5. SDDCs have high-speed access to native AWS services hosted within a separate customer-owned AWS account.
6. Native AWS services are billed to the customer-owned AWS account and are not managed by VMware.
